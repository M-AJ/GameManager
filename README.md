# GameManager 

GameManager is a full minigame API with utilities for any developer to create a minigame! It provides the essentials such as gamestate listeners and a tick task for updating scoreboards and server data. I have included an example minigame, Speed UHC!

## Features:
  * Utils (Chat, Scoreboard, etc...)
  * Nice Game State System
  * Tick based (Helpful for Countdowns)
  * Player Cache
  * Speed UHC Minigame Example Included
  * Easy Command Registry
 
  
This API's flexibility allows you to create any minigame, works extremely well with timers and event based games (SG, Skywars, UHC, etc...).
